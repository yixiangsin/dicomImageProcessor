# DICOM Image Processor

This repository contains a DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) image processing application developed using C++, Visual Studio, and the OpenCV library. The project is designed to provide tools for loading, processing, and analyzing DICOM images commonly used in medical imaging.

## Features

- Load and display DICOM images
- Basic image processing operations (e.g., filtering, contrast adjustment)
- Image analysis tools (e.g., segmentation, edge detection)
- Export processed images in common formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG)
- Cross-platform support via CMake build system

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- CMake 3.10 or later
- OpenCV 4.5 or later
- DCMTK (DICOM Toolkit) 3.6.5 or later
